\section{Results and Testing}
\label{sec:results-and-testing}
This chapter will focus on the results of the project, and the testing that was carried out to evaluate the performance of the different subsystems of the project. The chapter will be divided into three sections: Mechanical Design, Electronics and Software, and Computer Vision.

\subsection{Computer Vision}
\label{sec:computer-vision-evaluation}
This section will examine the Computer Vision system, as discussed in \autoref{sec:computer-vision-system} and implemented in \autoref{sec:computer-vision}.

\subsubsection{Component Detection Model}
The Component Detection model was trained on a dataset of 1076 images, split into a 70-20-10 split for training, validation, and testing respectively. The dataset was augmented using the augmentations discussed in \autoref{sec:image-processing}. The model was trained using the training parameters shown in \autoref{tab:training-parameters}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:iou}
  \end{figure}
  
As discussed in \autoref{sec:real-time-object-detection}, mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}} is a standard metric used to evaluate object detection models. mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} is a more rigorous metric that aggregates the mean average precision across all classes at different Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds; in mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}}, an object is considered as detected if the IoU is greater than 0.5 (the predicted bounding box overlaps the ground truth bounding box by at least 50\%), whereas in mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}}, the mAP score is aggregated across different IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05. This can be seen more clearly \autoref{fig:iou}, where the second bounding box would be detected in mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}}, but not in mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{75}}.

  \caption{TensorBoard graphing: all runs mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} against epochs}
  \label{fig:metrics}
\end{figure}
  
In \autoref{fig:metrics}, the mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} is shown for all training runs of the model with slightly different training parameters. It can be seen that the models tend to converge around 20 epochs, and there is a ceiling at around 80\% mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}}. This is likely due to the small dataset size, and it is made even smaller due to the use of a test set. For deployment, the training set will absorb the test set to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's performance, however for discussion it is necessary to keep a test set separate to objectively measure the model's performance.

  \caption{Final Model (blue) and non-pretrained model (orange) mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} and mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}} scores}
  \label{fig:final-model-metrics}
\end{figure}

As shown in \autoref{fig:final-model-metrics}, the final YOLO-OBB model (blue) achieved an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} of 82.8\% and an incredibly high mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}} of 99.5\%. This is an extremely impressive score given the relatively small size of the dataset (and made even smaller due to the need of the test set), which is truly a testament to YOLOv8's capabilities.

An experiment was run to see how the model would perform if the model was \textbf{not} pretrained on DOTOv1 \cite{9560031} given the low training time to see how much of an impact the pretraining had on the model's performance. The model, shown in orange, clearly takes much longer to converge; where the original model reaches 99.5\% mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}} for the first time in 18 epochs, the non-pretrained model had an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}} of 82.5\%, and takes 40 epochs to reach 98\%. By the time the pretrained model achieves an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} of at least 80\% on epoch 26, the non-pretrained model has an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} of 67.4\%. This is a substantial difference, and it is clear that pretraining on a large dataset is crucial to the model's performance and training time. When the model is pretrained on a large dataset, the model is able to learn generalisable, basic features such as edge and corner detection, which are common in most images. When the model is now trained on a new dataset, it does not need to relearn these basic features, and can instead focus on learning the more complex features of the new dataset. This is known as transfer learning, and it is a common technique used in deep learning to improve the performance of models on new datasets.

  \caption{All training runs mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} against epochs}
  \label{fig:allruns}
\end{figure}

For completeness, the mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} for all training runs is shown in \autoref{fig:allruns}, where the orange non-pretrained model is clearly lagging behind all other training runs.

To properly evaluate a model's performance, it is important to consider the model's performance on a test set. As described above, 10\% of the dataset was split for this, giving 98 + 10 background images for the test set.

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/graphs/confusion_matrix_final.png}
  \caption{Unnormalised confusion matrix for the test set}
  \label{fig:true-confusion-matrix}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:true-confusion-matrix}, the unnormalised confusion matrix is shown, with only diagonal entries, which shows 100\% accuracy on the test set. This is a very good sign, however it is important to remember that the dataset is very small, so the validation and test set has then been used to evaluate the model, as shown in \autoref{fig:final-model-confusion-matrix}. Although the model does not learn on the validation set, it still has seen the validation set during training which may cause the model to learn features that are specific to the validation set, which is why the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance. However, showing the confusion matrix for the validation and test set will be useful in this context to show the model's performance.

\end{figure}

This again is an exceptional result with no false positives or false negatives, and an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} of 82.8\%. The model is able to detect all components in the test set, and is able to classify them correctly. The model is able to generalise well to the test set, and is able to detect components that it has not seen before. In terms of the requirements of the project, the model is able to classify components with a high degree of accuracy.

A mosaic of inferences on the test set is shown in Appendix \autoref{app:mosaic} for a visual representation of the model's performance.

On the GTX 3080 Ti, 
  
Interestingly, if Class Loss is set to 1.0, Box Loss is set to 4.0, and DFL is set to 1.5, the model converges in around ~15 epochs, taking only ~2 minutes to train. However, the model's performance is slightly impacted, calculating metrics on the test set yields an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} of 77.8\%, but it was decided that the time savings were not worth it given it was only a few minutes of training time.

\subsubsection{Resistor Value Detection Model}
As discussed in \autoref{sec:resistor-value-detection}, the resistor value detection model is a standard YOLOn model trained on images produced by running inference on all resistor images with the component detection model and then cropping the bounding boxes. This meant that there were only 259 images in the dataset, which was then split 80-20 for training and validation; a test set was not used as the dataset was too small. This left only 208 images for training, and 51 images for validation.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/graphs/pixel_distrib.png}
  \caption{Distribution of image widths and heights}
  \label{fig:pixel-distrib}
\end{figure}

As the images are generated from the component detection model, the image size is no longer fixed, but instead varies based on the size of the bounding box. The distribution of image sizes is shown in \autoref{fig:pixel-distrib}, where the image sizes vary from 32x65 to 53x98. Due to this, a training parameter was set that would resize all images to a larger size of 128x128, to ensure that the model always works with the same size images.

  \label{tab:resistor-value-metrics}
\end{table}


However, due to the small image sizes and the small dataset, the model only achieved an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50-95}} of 45.7\% and an mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}} of 83.7\% as shown in \autoref{tab:resistor-value-metrics}. As we are more concerned about classifiying the resistor values correctly rather than the exact bounding box location, the mAP\raisebox{-1pt}{\textsuperscript{50}} is more important in this context. The model is able to classify some bands with high accuracy, such as brown, yellow, and violet, but struggles with others, such as blue and grey. After observing these results, the generated dataset was inspected more closely.

  \caption{Smallest and largest images in the resistor value dataset with inference results}
  \label{fig:resistor-value-dataset-sizes}
\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:resistor-value-dataset-sizes}, the smallest image in the dataset is on the left and the largest on the right. The resolution difference is obvious with the left images exhibiting more pixelation. For the low resolution image, the model was able to identify the red, brown, black and orange band as well as the stem, but fails to correctly determine the silver and grey bands. To human eye, the silver band actually seems white, and the grey band is hardly visible (it is at the top of the resistor). This shows that maybe the dataset itself is not very good, and the model is not at fault --- observing a full 640x480 image of the resistor as seen in \autoref{fig:full-resistor}, the resistor is very small and in terms of pixels, only takes up 0.74\% of the pixels in the original image.\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/cv/fullresistor.png}
  \caption{Raw image from camera of the smallest resistor in the dataset}
  \label{fig:full-resistor}
\end{figure}

This is a very small amount of pixels, and it is clear that the model is struggling to classify the bands due to the low resolution of the image, and clearly performs better on the larger image. This would be fixed by moving the camera closer to the belt to increase the relative size of the components of the image at the cost of a smaller field of view, and then a new dataset would have to be generated. Due to time constraints, this is not possible at the time of the report being written, but the model itself is performing well given the constraints of the dataset.

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/graphs/confusion_matrix_bands.png}
  \caption{Confusion matrix for the resistor value detection model}
  \label{fig:resistor-value-confusion-matrix}
\end{figure}

For completeness, the confusion matrix of the resistor detection model was shown in \autoref{fig:resistor-value-confusion-matrix},and shows a strong diagonal but with many false negatives; multiple bands not being identified at all, as shown by the row on the bottom. There is also severe class imbalance, with 91 total brown bands across the test set but only 2 gray and 5 blue.

Objectively, the model is performing well given the constraints of the dataset, and is able to classify resistor values with a high degree of accuracy. However, the performance of the model is not adequate enough to be deployed in the system as of the time of writing, and further work is needed to improve the model's to an acceptable standard.

\subsubsection{Inference Latency}
\label{sec:inference-latency-evaluation}
The inference latency of the model is crucial to the system's performance, as the system must be able to classify components in real-time. The Ultralytics and DeepSparse Python libraries come with their own benchmarking capabilities, and they were used to measure the model's performance. The benchmarks were performed on the Raspberry Pi 4, as this is the intended deployment platform for the system. The benchmarks were performed on the YOLO-OBB model, as it more complex than the standard YOLO model used for the resistor value classification model, and thus should be on the lower end of the performance spectrum.

\autoref{code:onnx-inference-latency} shows the inference latency of the model using the Onnxruntime library \cite{onnxruntime}, which is a popular library for running ONNX models. ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open-source format for AI models, and is supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. The model takes 1036ms to perform inference, which translates to ~0.96FPS on the Pi, an improvement of 81.1\% over the standard YOLO model. This is a significant improvement, however it is still not suitable for real-time object detection.

The DeepSparse library \cite{deepsparse} takes an ONNX model and uses its own engine to perform infernece at higher speeds. Using the library, the model is able to perform inference at 619ms, which translates to ~1.62FPS on the Pi, an improvement of 55.2\% over the standard Onnxruntime model, and an improvement of 203.8\% over the standard YOLO model. This is a significant improvement, and the model is now able to perform inference at a speed that is suitable for real-time object detection.

With these results, the Computer Vision system has met the requirements of the project, and is able to classify components in real-time. The system is able to detect components with a high degree of accuracy, and is able to classify them correctly.
