This paper presents a method to ensure an optimal operating performance of the new feeder at single or double line frequency. Hereby, the modular system's natural frequencies are adjusted adequately during the development phase by adapting the masses and inertias of the relevant components. This is done with the aid of a structural mechanical model of the modular feeding system, which is derived and verified on a product-neutral basic set-up. Finally, the application of the model during the development phase of the modular feeder is presented.}

Based on the leaf-spring modeling of the three legs of the symmetrically arranged bowl of the feeder, and equating the vibratory feeder to a three-legged parallel mechanism, the paper reveals the geometric property of the feeder. The effects of the leaf-spring legs are transformed to forces and moments acting on the base and bowl of the feeder. Resultant forces are obtained based upon the coordinate transformation, and the moment analysis is produced based upon the orthogonality of the orientation matrix. This reveals the characteristics of the feeder, that the resultant force is along the z-axis and the resultant moment is about the z direction and further generates the closed-form motion equation. The analysis presents a dynamic model that integrates the angular displacement of the bowl with the displacement of the leaf-spring legs. Both Newtonian and Lagrangian approaches are used to verify the model, and an industrial case-based simulation is used to demonstrate the results.}",

    ABSTRACT = {Currently used vibrational transportation methods are usually based on asymmetries of geometric, kinematic, wave, or time types. This paper investigates the vibrational transportation of objects on a platform that is subjected to sinusoidal displacement cycles, employing periodic dynamic dry friction control. This manner of dry friction control creates an asymmetry, which is necessary to move the object. The theoretical investigation on functional capabilities and transportation regimes was carried out using a developed parametric mathematical model, and the control parameters that determine the transportation characteristics such as velocity and direction were defined. To test the functional capabilities of the proposed method, an experimental setup was developed, and experiments were carried out. The results of the presented research indicate that the proposed method ensures smooth control of the transportation velocity in a wide range and allows it to change the direction of motion. Moreover, the proposed method offers other new functional capabilities, such as a capability to move individual objects on the same platform in opposite directions and at different velocities at the same time by imposing different friction control parameters on different regions of the platform or on different objects. In addition, objects can be subjected to translation and rotation at the same time by imposing different friction control parameters on different regions of the platform. The presented research extends the classical theory of vibrational transportation and has a practical value for industries that operate manufacturing systems performing tasks such as handling and transportation, positioning, feeding, sorting, aligning, or assembling.},

    ABSTRACT = {Pneumatic conveying is a vital technology for delivering bulk solids, powders, and granular materials in various industries. Significant advances in pneumatic conveying technology have occurred in recent years, spurred by the demand for sustainable and energy-efficient industrial processes. This paper explores the current advances in pneumatic conveying technology and their implications for the industry. First, the principles of pneumatic conveying are discussed. Then, two significant advances in pneumatic conveying technology are highlighted. Schenck Process, for example, has created the Enhanced Dilute Phase Pneumatic Conveying (EDIP) system, the E-Finity continuous dense phase system, and high-pressure systems utilizing Lontra&rsquo;s LP2 Compressor Blower. Second, Palamatic Process provides dense-phase vacuum conveying cyclones as well as powder pumps for nonabrasive dense-phase vacuum conveying. Several research gaps in pneumatic conveying technology are identified in the paper, including the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the optimization of multiphase flow behavior, energy efficiency and sustainability, material degradation, and particle damage, handling of cohesive and difficult-to-convey materials, scale-up and design optimization, and real-time monitoring and control systems. The future outlook highlights the potential of sustainable practices to advance pneumatic conveying technology further. The integration of these technologies can lead to improved performance, energy efficiency, and sustainability in pneumatic conveying systems.},

ABSTRACT = {Economic and environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important in today&rsquo;s world. Electronic waste (e-waste) is on the rise and options to reuse parts should be explored. Hence, this paper presents the development of vision-based methods for the detection and classification of used electronics parts. In particular, the problem of classifying commonly used and relatively expensive electronic project parts such as capacitors, potentiometers, and voltage regulator ICs is investigated. A multiple object workspace scenario with an overhead camera is investigated. A customized object detection algorithm determines regions of interest and extracts data for classification. Three classification methods are explored: (a) shallow neural networks (SNNs), (b) support vector machines (SVMs), and (c) deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All three methods utilize 30 &times; 30-pixel grayscale image inputs. Shallow neural networks achieved the lowest overall accuracy of 85.6%. The SVM implementation produced its best results using a cubic kernel and principal component analysis (PCA) with 20 features. An overall accuracy of 95.2% was achieved with this setting. The deep learning CNN model has three convolution layers, two pooling layers, one fully connected layer, softmax, and a classification layer. The convolution layer filter size was set to four and adjusting the number of filters produced little variation in accuracy. An overall accuracy of 98.1% was achieved with the CNN model.},
