\section{Implementation} \label{sec:implementation}
Three systems compromise the project:
\begin{mylist}
  \item The Hardware, Mechanics and Electronics
  \item The software that coordinates the various components
  \item The computer vision system
\end{mylist}

\noindent
It is important to note that the system has undergone significant design changes during its development. The following section
will discuss the final implementation of the system, and a seperate section has been dedicated for discussion on design changes
and problems faced during development that helped inform the final design.
% It is important to note that for the initial version of the system, prior to conducting a comprehensive literature review,
% the system's design incorporated a face-up camera intended to identify components placed on an acrylic plate directly above it.
% This design was chosen as it was the simplest design that would allow for component identification and could 
% be easily implemented using available resources. Additionally, the camera used in the system had 
% a short ribbon cable, which limited the distance between the camera and the Pi. This would have made the face-down
% design more difficult to reasonably immediately implement, especially with the LCD. A longer ribbon cable was ordered
% for this purpose.
