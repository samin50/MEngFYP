\section{Project Specification}
This project aims to solve the problem of electronic waste and cluttered workspaces in the Level 1 Labs
by developing an automated system for identifying and sorting electronic components.

It aims to do so by employing state of the art Computer Vision techniques to classify various electronic components,
and then sort them into designated bins. The project's deliverables are as follows:
\begin{mylist}
  \item A Computer Vision system for component identification
  \item An interface from which to observe and control the system's state
  \item A semi-automated sorting mechanism
  \item Potentially, full automation of the sorting process or additional features like IC testing
\end{mylist}
