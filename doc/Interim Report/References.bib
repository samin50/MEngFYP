This paper presents a method to ensure an optimal operating performance of the new feeder at single or double line frequency. Hereby, the modular system's natural frequencies are adjusted adequately during the development phase by adapting the masses and inertias of the relevant components. This is done with the aid of a structural mechanical model of the modular feeding system, which is derived and verified on a product-neutral basic set-up. Finally, the application of the model during the development phase of the modular feeder is presented.}

Based on the leaf-spring modeling of the three legs of the symmetrically arranged bowl of the feeder, and equating the vibratory feeder to a three-legged parallel mechanism, the paper reveals the geometric property of the feeder. The effects of the leaf-spring legs are transformed to forces and moments acting on the base and bowl of the feeder. Resultant forces are obtained based upon the coordinate transformation, and the moment analysis is produced based upon the orthogonality of the orientation matrix. This reveals the characteristics of the feeder, that the resultant force is along the z-axis and the resultant moment is about the z direction and further generates the closed-form motion equation. The analysis presents a dynamic model that integrates the angular displacement of the bowl with the displacement of the leaf-spring legs. Both Newtonian and Lagrangian approaches are used to verify the model, and an industrial case-based simulation is used to demonstrate the results.}",

The results show high performance in recognition accuracy, with ROC and AUC for capacitor and inductor reaching 1.0, and a reasoning time of about 2.67 ms, achieving industrial application level in terms of time consumption and performance.}

ABSTRACT = {Economic and environmental sustainability is becoming increasingly important in today&rsquo;s world. Electronic waste (e-waste) is on the rise and options to reuse parts should be explored. Hence, this paper presents the development of vision-based methods for the detection and classification of used electronics parts. In particular, the problem of classifying commonly used and relatively expensive electronic project parts such as capacitors, potentiometers, and voltage regulator ICs is investigated. A multiple object workspace scenario with an overhead camera is investigated. A customized object detection algorithm determines regions of interest and extracts data for classification. Three classification methods are explored: (a) shallow neural networks (SNNs), (b) support vector machines (SVMs), and (c) deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All three methods utilize 30 &times; 30-pixel grayscale image inputs. Shallow neural networks achieved the lowest overall accuracy of 85.6%. The SVM implementation produced its best results using a cubic kernel and principal component analysis (PCA) with 20 features. An overall accuracy of 95.2% was achieved with this setting. The deep learning CNN model has three convolution layers, two pooling layers, one fully connected layer, softmax, and a classification layer. The convolution layer filter size was set to four and adjusting the number of filters produced little variation in accuracy. An overall accuracy of 98.1% was achieved with the CNN model.},
