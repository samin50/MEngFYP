\subsection{Software}
The entire system is controlled by a Raspberry Pi 4B running a very light weight Linux distribution called DietPi.
I aim for the entire system to run locally on the Pi, and so the Pi will be responsible for running the Computer Vision system,
controlling the hardware, and running the user interface. In order to achieve this, I have identified the following software components:
\begin{mylist}
  \item The user interface
  \item The Computer Vision system
  \item The hardware control system
  \item The system coordinator
\end{mylist}
The system's software is written in Python, as it is a language I am familiar with and is well suited for the project, given the 
availability of libraries for Computer Vision and hardware control. Again, the concept of modularity underpins the design of the software,
and so each component is designed to be independent of the others, and can be developed in parallel.
