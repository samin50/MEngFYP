\subsection{Design Problems}
3D printing is typically an iterative process, where the design is printed, tested, and then modified based on the results.
This further reinforces the need for a modular design, as it allows for easy modification of each component.
After a few iterations with errors due to tolerances and slightly incorrect measurements, (not relevant to the technical content of this report)
I was able to produce a design that physically fit together and mounted the components as intended, however when combined with the software
and electronics, I encountered a few problems that I had to overcome by making some design decisions.
