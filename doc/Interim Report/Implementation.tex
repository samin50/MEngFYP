\section{Implementation}
% Introduction
The project is to be executed in three stages:
\begin{mylist}
  \item Initial development of a Computer Vision system for component identification
  \item Integration of a semi-automated sorting mechanism
  \item Potentially, full automation of the sorting process or additional features like IC testing
\end{mylist}
This approach was taken to allow me to set defined goals to ensure that the project is always working towards a deliverable product.
Each stage extends the previous stage, and so the project can be considered as a series of smaller projects. 

For this initial stage in the project, the focus is on developing the foundation for the system to be built upon so that
the development of the various systems can be done independently, in parallel, and in such a way that each system
is modular and easily extensible.
I have identified four systems that compromise the project:
\begin{mylist}
  \item The Hardware, Mechanics and Electronics
  \item The software that coordinates the various components
  \item The Computer Vision system
  \item The tools used to develop the system
\end{mylist}
