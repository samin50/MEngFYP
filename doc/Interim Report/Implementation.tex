\section{Implementation}
Three systems compromise the project:
\begin{mylist}
  \item The Hardware, Mechanics and Electronics
  \item The software that coordinates the various components
  \item The Computer Vision system
\end{mylist}

\noindent
It is important to note that for the initial version of the system, prior to conducting a comprehensive literature review,
the system's design incorporated a face-up camera intended to identify components placed on an acrylic plate directly above it.
This design was chosen as it was the simplest design that would allow for component identification and could 
be easily implemented using available resources. Additionally, the camera used in the system came with
a short ribbon cable, which limited the distance between the camera and the Pi, which would have made the face-down
design more difficult to reasonably implement, especially with the LCD.
